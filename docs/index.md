title: Welcome to pro-theme!
---

pro-theme is a simple and minimalist Jekyll theme to use with GitHub pages. The idea for the theme was borne out of a need to have a uniform look to my professional web site and the project websites of my Github projects. The theme will receive regular updates for the forseeable future. 

The theme is based on [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and makes use of the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon set.
