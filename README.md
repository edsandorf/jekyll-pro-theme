Pro-theme is a simple [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme to use with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The theme is based on [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/), makes use of the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon set and [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) for code syntax highlighting. Bootstrap's responsive CSS classes ensures that the theme also works on mobile devices.

The idea for the theme was borne out of a need to have a uniform look to my professional web site and my Github project websites. The theme is constantly evolving and changing to fit my changing needs as my projects develop. Creating a theme was a way for me to keep code duplication to a minimum and make maintenance easier across my projects. Hopefully, someone else will also find it useful.
